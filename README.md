# Logodesign-Task-2

"Task 2 complete!"

I've been diving deep into the world of cloud computing and AI to create a logo that captures the essence of both. 

This  logo design explores following things : 
1. Research and Inspiration
I start by gathering inspiration from cloud services (like AWS, Microsoft Azure) and Al-related visuals. Logos that embody intelligence, technology, and connectivity often use abstract symbols and clean, modern typography.
I'll also look into color psychology: blues and light grays work well for tech brands as they evoke trust and reliability, while a pop of color like yellow or green can suggest energy and innovation.
2. Sketching Ideas
Initial sketches focus on combining cloud imagery with something that hints at intelligence or connectivity.
One idea could be a cloud made up of interconnected lines or circuits (representing Al and networking).
Another idea could feature a brain-like shape within the cloud, emphasizing intelligence and problem-solving.
I'll experiment with various combinations of these two concepts, keeping the design simple yet impactful.
3. Typography
The font needs to feel modern and clean. Something sans-serif works well, as it gives off a minimalistic and professional vibe.
I might choose a font that has rounded edges to maintain a friendly and approachable feel. If the word
"CloudMind" is long, I may consider shortening it to just "CM" for simplicity in certain contexts.
4. Colors
Primary Color: A cool-toned blue as the main color for trust and reliability.
Accent Color: A bright yellow or green to signify innovation and fresh ideas.
Secondary Colors: Shades of gray or white to maintain simplicity and balance.
After finalizing the sketches, l'll digitize the selected design using vector software like Adobe Illustrator.
The finalized logo will include the cloud symbol with circuit lines or a brain-like feature embedded into the cloud.
The text "CloudMind" will sit below or beside the graphic, depending on spacing]
Thank you for this wonderful and innovation logo making task
